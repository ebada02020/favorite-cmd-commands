# 1- % cd
### cd takes a directory name as an argument, and switches into that directory.

# 2- % ls
### ls lists all files and directories in the working directory

# 3- % pwd
### pwd prints the name of the working directory

# 4- % touch
### touch creates a new file inside the working directory. It takes in a file name as an argument, and then creates a new empty file in the current working directory. Here we used touch to create a new file named keyboard.txt inside the 2014/dec/ directory.
